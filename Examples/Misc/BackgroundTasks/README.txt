Database Setup
----------------
By default, this demo app uses a temporary H2 database, so you don't need to do anything to run the demo.


Alternative MySQL Database Setup
---------------------------------
Simple navigate to the Resources folder of this project in the Terminal and run this command which will create
the database, the app user (guest user with password = 'password' and localhost access only):

$ mysql -u root -p < threadsdemo-01.sql


There is a launch configuration included that increases memory
